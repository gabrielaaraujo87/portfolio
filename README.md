# Gabriela Araujo Portfolio

Welcome to my web portfolio! This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my work, experiences, and aspirations. In this README, I'll provide an overview of my development process, the challenges I encountered, and what I've learned throughout this project.

## Development Process

During the creation of my web portfolio, I followed these general steps:

1. **Design and Planning:** I started by outlining the structure of the website and designing its layout. I wanted a clean and visually appealing design that reflects my personality and showcases my work effectively.

2. **HTML and Bootstrap:** I used HTML for structuring the content and integrated the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and styling. This allowed me to create a visually consistent and mobile-friendly website.

3. **Content Creation:** I wrote the content for various sections of the portfolio, such as introduction, experiences, and aspirations. I aimed to convey my personality and passion for media and creativity.

4. **Navigation:** I implemented a navigation menu using Bootstrap's navbar component. This ensures easy navigation for users to explore different sections of the portfolio.

5. **Images and Assets:** I included images that represent my work and experiences. These images help in conveying my journey and skills visually.

6. **Social Media Links:** I added links to my social media profiles using icons from popular platforms. This allows visitors to connect with me through various channels.

7. **Challenges and Learning:** As with any project, I faced challenges along the way, which leads me to the next section.

## Challenges and Learning

While working on this portfolio, I encountered a few challenges:

1. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring consistent design across different devices was challenging. Bootstrap's responsive features helped, but I had to fine-tune some aspects to achieve the desired responsiveness.

2. **CSS Customization:** Although Bootstrap provides ready-made styles, customizing some elements required me to delve into CSS. This was a valuable learning experience, and I gained a better understanding of styling principles.

3. **Content Presentation:** Presenting my experiences and aspirations in a compelling way required thoughtful content organization and clear communication. I learned the importance of concise and engaging content.

## Assets and Resources Used

Here are some of the assets and resources I used for building my web portfolio:

- [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for responsive design and styling.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Provided icons for social media links.

## Conclusion

Creating this web portfolio was an enriching experience that allowed me to combine my passion for creativity and media with web development. I learned valuable skills in design, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, while also showcasing my journey and aspirations. I'm excited to continue expanding and improving my portfolio as I progress in my career.
